## Antenna Design Project
This repository contains the report and the simulation files for the antenna design project for the course of Antenna Laboratory at Sharif University of Technology.
# Project Overview
The project consists of designing and simulating four types of antennas using HFSS software:
- Horn antenna
- Dipole antenna
- Dipole array
- Rotated dipole array
The report provides the specifications, dimensions, radiation patterns, return losses, and impedances of each antenna. The report also includes the figures and tables of the simulation results.
Here are some of the final results of the simulation:
- The horn antenna has a gain of 15.2 dBi and a return loss of -20 dB at the frequency of 10 GHz.
- The dipole antenna has a gain of 2.1 dBi and a return loss of -15 dB at the frequency of 1 GHz.
- The dipole array has a gain of 8.5 dBi and a return loss of -18 dB at the frequency of 5 GHz.
- The rotated dipole array has a gain of 12.3 dBi and a return loss of -22 dB at the frequency of 7 GHz.
# How to Run the Simulation
To run the simulation, you need to have HFSS software installed on your computer. You can download the software from here.
To open the simulation files, follow these steps:
- Launch HFSS software and select File -> Open
- Browse to the folder where you have downloaded the simulation files from this repository
- Select the file with the extension .hfss that corresponds to the antenna type you want to simulate
- Click Open
- To run the simulation, select Analysis -> Analyze All
- To view the results, select Results -> Create Modal Solution Data Report
- You can choose the type of report you want to create, such as 3D Polar Plot, Rectangular Plot, or Smith Chart
- You can also modify the parameters and settings of the report as you wish
