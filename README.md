# Antenna Lab Project
This project is about designing and simulating different types of antennas using HFSS software. The project consists of two parts:

## Part 1: Pyramidal Horn Antenna1
- Design a pyramidal horn antenna for working at the specified center frequency and realized gain.
- Draw the antenna in HFSS and use the formulas from Balanisâ€™ book to find the appropriate dimensions.
- Plot the return loss of the antenna in the frequency range of f0-1GHz to f0+1GHz, where f0 is the center frequency.
- Plot the radiation pattern of the realized gain in dB in the E-plane and H-plane at the center frequency.
## Part 2: Half-Wave Dipole Antenna Array2
- Design a half-wave dipole antenna for working at the specified center frequency and adjust the length of the dipole to match the desired frequency.
- Draw the antenna in HFSS and plot the frequency response in the range of f0-2GHz to f0+2GHz, where f0 is the center frequency.
- Plot the radiation pattern of the realized gain in dB in the E-plane and H-plane at the center frequency.
- Draw an array of three dipole antennas on the x-axis with half-wavelength spacing and excite them with equal amplitude and phase.
- Plot the 2D and 3D radiation patterns of the realized gain in dB in the H-plane at the center frequency.
- Calculate the phase difference between the elements to rotate the radiation pattern by a specified angle with respect to the broadside direction.
- Apply the phase difference in HFSS and plot the 2D and 3D radiation patterns of the realized gain in dB in the H-plane at the center frequency.
